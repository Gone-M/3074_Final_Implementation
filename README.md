Personal Restaurant Guide

This is my Personal Restaurant Guide project for the Mobile App Development course. In this project, I've developed an Android app that helps users discover and manage their favorite restaurants.

Features

Restaurant List: Displays a list of restaurants with their details.
Add Restaurant: Allows users to add new restaurant information.
About Page: Contains information about the app and its features.
Restaurant Cards: Restaurants are displayed in a card layout for easy viewing.
My Contributions

I made the following contributions to the project:

RestaurantAdapter.java: Improved the adapter for the restaurant list. This update optimizes how restaurant data is displayed and managed within the app.
restaurant_card.xml: Designed and created the layout for displaying restaurant information in a card view.
